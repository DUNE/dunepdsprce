# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# VERSION : 0.0.2
# RELEASED: 2017.11.01
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support for builds on the MAC.  Surprisingly there were almost no
changes because of this to the package specific (here dam) Makefile.
These changes were due to name changes and version number updates. The
name changes were because of a poor selection.  'reader' was just too
generic to expose.

The main activity was
  1. Changing include file names
     For example malloc.h does not exist on the Mac, this information
     is present in stdlib.h.
  2. The compiler on the Mac caught a few errors that the 6.2 compiler
     on Linux did not. These were fixed.
  3. memalign does is not supported.   Had to use posix_memalign.
  

Name Changes
  1.  reader -> PdReaderTest
  2   wibFrame_test -> PdWibFrameTest

File changes
  1. dam/access/TpcFragment.hh
     a) Compiler complained that the class member m_df was unused.
     This seems to be a mistake on the compiler, because it is
     initialized in the class constructor.  Nevertheless, to make
     progress, it has been marked with __attribute__ ((unused))
     
  2. dam/access/TpcRanges.hh
     a) Marked class field member m_rsvd as unused in three different
     classes ((TpcRangesIndices, TpcRangesTimestamps, TpcRangeWindow).
     This field is used to pad to an integral 64-bit boundary.

  3. dam/access/TpcStream.hh
     a) Removed a commented out include file (dam/records/Data.hh"
     b) Marked file member m_rsvd as unused.

  4. dam/access/AignedAllocator.hh
     a) Had to change malloc.h -> stdlib.h (no malloc.h on the Mac)
     b) Had to use posix_memalign (no memalign on the Mac)

  5. make/Makefile
     a) Change so the common build is x86_64.  This covers the builds
     for Linux and the Mac.
     b) Set the name of the shareable suffix to .so for Linux
        .dylib for Mac. 
        The makeutilities should provide a function to do this so
        that this is not in the user's Makefile
     c) reader -> PdReaderTest
     d) wibFrame_test -> PdWibFrameTest
     e) Version -> 0.0.2
     


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# VERSION : 0.0.1
# RELEASED: 2017.10.23
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

This comes much closer to a production release.  This is still a 0.x.x
release meaning it is still evolving.  I am not confident that I have
isolated the user from anticipated changes.  It may take one more round
and a little experience.

CODE ORGANIZATION
-----------------
The include files have been organized as follows  

1. dam/ 
   Where the includes defining the high-level interface reside.  These
   are expected to be sufficient for most users.


2. dam/access
   The low-level access routines reside here. Most users will not use
   these.  However debugging and certain diagnostic code will find these
   useful.  The high-level interface is built on top of this interface.

3. dam/records
   The definitions of the physical data layout (except for WibFrame) 
   reside here.  While this is still in the public include file area,
   it is not meant to be included in user code. This is more so that 
   outside users can see the layout.  It is subject to change whereas
   those in dam/ and dam/access should be very stable


SHAREABLES
----------
There are 3 shareables now produced
    1. One for generic x86 64-bit architectures
    2. One for those CPUs with AVX support
    3. One for those CPUS with AVX2 support

Currently the AVX image is the same as the generic image.  A subsequent
release will specialize this image for AVX.

SETUP SCRIPTS
-------------
A setup script, scripts/settings.csh or settings.sh will setup PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to select the most efficient implementation for
that executing platform.
